Egraph-in-DFG work

we need to incorporate:
- egraph build
- opt rule invocation
- egraph elaboration

- new Value kind: Union
  - (x) add Union def
  - print in CLIF
  - parse in CLIF
- Write a pass that subsumes the CLIF-to-egraph-to-CLIF process:
  - (1 only) apply existing GVN
  - (1) (x) removes non-skeleton nodes from Layout
  - (2) tracks analysis values for every Value
  - (2) does a GVN
    - eventually also: does rule application during GVN pass
  - (2) chooses best value out of every eclass (union tree)
  - (1) place nodes back into layout based on elaboration

- (3) add opt rule invocation

misc cleanup:
- "unreachable blocks" not "unreachable code"
- do const prop + branch folding before DCE?

- revisit pseudo-loops; can we do LICM properly?

- factor unsafe code in ctxhash out to separate crate?

- remove InstructionImms from generated code
