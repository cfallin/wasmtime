//! Wasmtime debugger functionality.
//!
//! This crate builds on top of the core Wasmtime crate's
//! guest-debugger APIs to present an environment where a debugger
//! runs as a "co-running process" and sees the debuggee as a a
//! provider of a stream of events, on which actions can be taken
//! between each event.
//!
//! In the future, this crate will also provide a WIT-level API and
//! world in which to run debugger components.
