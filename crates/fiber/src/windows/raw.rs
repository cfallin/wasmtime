//! Raw fibers on top of Windows fibers.
//!
//! `SwitchToFiber` saves a fiber's stack pointer and nonvolatile registers in
//! the fiber's undocumented, heap-allocated `FIBER` structure rather than on
//! its stack, so the stack bytes alone do not capture where to resume a
//! suspended fiber. Instead every suspension goes through one canonical frame:
//! the suspend routine spills all nonvolatile registers onto the fiber's
//! stack, stores the stack pointer in a reserved slot, and calls
//! `SwitchToFiber` with a fixed stack pointer near the top of the stack. What
//! Windows saves is thus the same at every suspension, and when
//! `SwitchToFiber` returns the suspend routine takes everything else from the
//! slot and the stack. A raw fiber's snapshot therefore captures it completely,
//! just as on other platforms, while Windows keeps managing everything else
//! about the fiber: its stack bounds, fiber-local storage, and so on.
//!
//! The start routine suspends through the same frame once before calling the
//! entry point, so a new raw fiber is a suspended fiber whose continuation
//! calls its entry point.
//!
//! The top of a raw fiber's stack, where `top` is its `switch_arg`, is:
//!
//! ```text
//!                 frames of `fiber_start` and Windows' own fiber start (fixed)
//! top + 8         return address into `fiber_start`
//! top             frame pointer of `fiber_start`
//! top - 0x08      host fiber to suspend to, stored by each resume
//! top - 0x10      stack pointer to resume this fiber at
//!                 frame from which the suspend routine calls `SwitchToFiber`
//! top - SCRATCH   start of the entry point's stack
//! ```
//!
//! A raw fiber's `FiberStack` reports its range as the bottom of the stack's
//! reservation up to `top`, which is also what it reports as the stack's top.
